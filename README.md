# LinkWorm :bug:

**LinkWorm** is a CLI app that allows you to save links, view all links you've saved, select favorites and mark the ones you've visited. All links are stored in your own private repository. Built using Ruby and countless Gems.

![How to run](https://i.imgur.com/7FVvIvx.png)

## First things first:

1. Clone this repository onto your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Run `bundle install` in your terminal to download all the necessary gems.
3. Run `rake db:migrate` to create the database.
4. Run `rake db:seed` to seed the database automatically.
5. Last, but definitely not least, run `ruby bin/run.rb` to start the app. Enjoy!

**Quick Note** \*If having trouble running 'rake' commands, use **bundle exec rake**\*
